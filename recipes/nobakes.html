        Description
    </h2>
    <p>No bake cookies are comprised mostly of chocolate and peanut butter, they are easy to make and delicious</p>
   <div><h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
       <li>Milk</li> 
        <li>Unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>Vanilla</li>
        <li>Quick oats</li>
       <li>Peanut butter</li> 
    </ul> 
</div> 
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First line two baking sheets with parchment paper (or just spread a long sheet of the parchment onto the counter), or have 29 cupcake liners set out.</li>
        <li>Then in a 2.5 â€“ 3 quart saucepan combine sugar, butter, cocoa powder and milk.</li>
        <li>Set saucepan over medium heat (I like to use the largest burner on the stove) and begin whisking. Cook and whisk frequently until it reaches a boil, then once it reaches a full boil stop stirring and let it boil for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Remove the mixture from heat then immediately add in vanilla, peanut butter and oatmeal. And stir to blend well.</li>
        <li>Drop mixture onto prepared parchment dropping 2 Tbsp at a time (a medium cookie scoop works well here or just use two large spoons).
            <li>Let cookies set then enjoy! If you want to speed up setting transfer to refrigerator. Store the cookies at room temp in an airtight container.</li>

    </ol>
