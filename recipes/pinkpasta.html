        Description
    </h2>
    <p>Pink Pasta has a creamy tomato sauce, add chicken for maximum flavor and contentment! </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>2 Tablespoons Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
        <li>1/2 large yellow onion, chopped </li>
       <li>1 clove of garlic, minced</li> 
        <li>1 28 oz. can whole, peeled of San Marzano tomatoes</li>
        <li> teaspoon sea salt or kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 lb rigatoni or other pasta</li>
       <li>3/4 cup heavy cream</li> 
       <li>1 cup finely grated Parmigiano Reggiano</li>
       <li>1 cup fresh basil leaves, chopped (optional)</li>

    </ul> 
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in large pot or dutch oven over medium heat. Add onions and cook for 5 minutes or until onions are soft and translucent, stirring occasionally. Add garlic and cook for an additional minute. Do not brown or burn onions or garlic.</li>
        <li>Using your hands, break up the San Marzano tomatoes as you pour them into the large pot. This will release the juices and help break up the tomatoes so they cook evenly. Add salt and bring to a soft boil, then lower heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook until al dente.</li>
        <li>After tomatoes have cooked for 30 minutes, use an immersion blender in your large pot to blend the sauce into a creamy, smooth consistency. You may need to tilt your pot to one side so the sauce can gather and your blender is fully immersed. ** Keep the pot on low heat and add cream, Parmigiano Reggiano, basil and stir until smooth.</li>
        <li>Once the pasta is cooked, remove 1 cup of pasta water from the pot and set aside. Add hot pasta to sauce and stir to combine. Remove from heat and add 1/2 to 1 cup of pasta water, adding more if your sauce is too thick. The pasta sauce will quickly set up as it cools. Serve immediately with additional grated parm if desired.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>* You may use any tomatoes you have on hand, but using both San Marzano tomatoes and tomatoes that are still whole typically yields better flavor. </p>
    <p>** If you do not have an immersion blender, you can blend your tomato sauce in a traditional blender to make smooth. Make sure you let your sauce cool for a few minutes before blending, or the pressure from the hot sauce will make the blender lid burst off in the process.</p>
